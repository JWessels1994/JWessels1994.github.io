Are literature and computational research compatible? This is one of the central questions critics of the Digital Humanities field have been posing, as collecting data on bodies of texts can seem intimidating to the more old school literary scholar. The Digital Humanities, loosely defined, is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of digital technologies and the humanities. DH skills and research provide new data and insights on bodies of texts that could not be done without the use of computational skills. 

When the question was posed at the start of our DH course as to how we personally would define the Digital Humanities, thoughts and opinions began to pile up until we were confronted with defining the exact border of this field. With DH constantly expanding, it seems a bit arbitrary to argue what exactly is and is not apart of this realm. I found a more pointed question when considering the uses and reach of DH to be that of DH scholar Michael Gavin, are DH findings robust? Although this may sound like an obvious question after being exposed to the numerous impactful findings that have come about using DH tools on bodies of texts, Gavin hits a central nerve of research for many humanities scholars, if DH findings belong under that category of the humanities and the literary. 

When it comes to tackling this question, I am in agreeance with Gavin that DH work is not centered on the production of texts, but rather is an entirely new form of textuality (21).  I first realized that DH and literary studies were in fact compatible after reading Salman Rushdie’s Luka and the Fire of Life. In this brilliantly constructed novel, Rushdie creates a storyline inspired by the digital humanities, or more specifically, video games. Written for his 13-year-old son, this novel uses different chapters to represent the different levels in a game and models characters and their abilities after classic video game archetypes.

Following my experience of reading Luka and the Fire of Life, I decided to create a very basic video game (with the help of my tech savvy cousin) to attempt to comprehend what kind of DH skills were needed and how storytelling and the literary intertwine. Before actually constructing the game, I had to create the backstory and imagine what kind of levels, abilities, obstacles and characters I wanted to include in my game. I also had to understand what tools I had to work with in bringing my ideas to “life” so as to keep my imagination and the reality of what I could build in sync. 

Creating the game was definitely a process of trail and error. When placing a tunnel or a grenade launcher, I had no idea how it would effect the game. At first I would simply place these things around and hit the “test” option to see what would happen. After realizing what certain things did, I was able to go back in and alter their positions in the game to enhance the plot of my back-story. In the end I was mostly satisfied with my game and could see my story idea reflected in the overall structure. I enjoyed the process of working almost backwards from what I imagined Rushdie’s creative process was, in my case using a story to inspire a video game and in his being inspired by a video game to structure a story. 

In reflecting on my reading of Luka and the Fire of Life and Subsequential dabbling in game creation, I first handedly got to experience a fusion of the digital and the humanities and would have to say that both complimented the other quiet well. Although the literary and the digital can of course exist independently of one another, the fusion of both sets of skills results in a new creation of textuality that expands the field of humanities and thus opens the doors to new ways of representing and capturing the human experience. 

Envisioning the future, I can imagine a world where the digital continues to influence the literary, as we are already beginning to experience with younger generations turning to platforms such as Youtube to document their lives via “vlogs” rather than keeping journals or with students taking advantage of digital story map programs embedded with audio and images to represent stories of movement rather than sticking to paper maps and written text. With this movement I find it only fitting that DH tools would continue to be created and utilized to examine traditional texts in a new light, and encourage even the most traditional of literary stars to utilize and embrace these findings.
