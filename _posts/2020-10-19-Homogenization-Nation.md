Last week, having explored some of the beneficial ways the digital can effects the humanities, I find it only fair to admit a few of my apprehensions with larger industries embracing some of these tools. My largest fear to date is that of a “homogenization” of both the literary and job applicant market. 

With the boom of social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Youtube to name a few, individuals have been able to present and gain audiences for creative works far easier in this decade than any other. In tandem with this boom, such incentives as Twitter Pitch parties have come to fruition, where aspiring writers are able to post 280 characters related to the central questions, conflicts and obstacles that their main characters must face in hopes of gaining the attention of publishing agents (McGrath). The goal behind a Twitter Pitch Party, as explained by DH scholar Laura McGrath, is to, break down structural inequalities and allow for more diverse publications within the literary realm. 

By having aspiring authors post their pitches in the formulaic presentation of 280 characters focused on character central question, conflict and obstacle structure, McGrath was able to use the DH tool of topic modeling (a type of computational text analysis) to better understand the themes shared by these groups of texts. McGrath ended up finding that most authors focused on actions and genre specific terminology. Taking this investigation one step further, McGrath then compared this finding to the top terminology that publishers were favoring and found that agent models appeared to privilege what writer models ignored, description. Additionally agents seemed to be less interested in genre specific lingo (Mcgrath). 

What can be concluded from all of these findings? One reality is that the majority of aspiring writers works are not lining up with agent’s desires. In turn, if an aspiring author from the Twitter Pitch Party were to come across McGrath’s findings, most likely said author would end up altering their pitch and larger work to have a higher chance of catching an agent’s eye. If all of the writers in the Twitter Pitch Party were presented with this data, and all authors ended up editing their work to fit the agents desired writing style and topic, diversity of genre and creative license would begin to disappear.

Continuing along this vein, if publishing agents were to use natural language processing tools (NLP’s) to sift through manuscripts for key words or genre topics and eliminate any submissions that did not comply with their standards, I fear that enormous pools of talent would be overlooked and large-scale structural inequalities within the publishing industry would be perpetuated. 

This exact phenomenon could also occur within the job hiring industry in relation to sifting through resumes. As presented by authors and data scientists Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein in their groundbreaking text Data Feminism, in 2018 Amazon had been developing an algorithm to screen its first-round job applicants. D’Ignazio and Klein explain, “because the model had trained on the resumes of prior applicants, who were predominantly male, it developed an even stronger preference for male candidates. It downgraded resumes with the word women and graduates of women’s colleges” (chpt. 1).

Although disheartening, I cannot say that this finding was shocking as I had been told a number of times in crafting my own resume or cover letters to attempt to include the key vocabulary used by the job posting so as to have a higher chance of being “matched” as a good candidate for the role. Having grown up in the age of standardized testing I feel it has been slightly engrained within the millennial generation to craft our writing to check the boxes of whoever or whatever may be “grading” which has resulted in large amounts of writing anxiety and blocks to creativity or the willingness to think independently. 

When considering new media and the homogenization of culture, I am brought back to my experience in creating a twitter bot. A highly sophisticated yet rather simple process, I was able to utilize a guide, copy and past the text of Animal Farm into a vocabulary index, connect my coding forum to my twitter account and bam, the account was up, running and spewing very strange tweets within a matter of hours. Sadly my bot was ultimately deactivated for “bot like” activity, but the experience opened my eyes to how a more senior programmer would have no issue in creating a bot to regurgitate political or other information. With other twitter users being unaware that this information is coming from a bot, bots could ultimately be used to dominate the Twitter platform to push a certain ideology or point of view to the masses.

Despite my anxieties surrounding the homogenization of the literary and job market realms, I do still believe that the DH tools being used to collect data on trends in the writing and work place market are essential. Although these tools can be used for “evil” (homogenizing culture, keeping structural barriers in place) they can just as easily be used for “good” (keeping a pulse on current trends/ finding gaps of literary genres or ethnicities missing from the literary and workplace market). These DH tools are just that, tools, and ultimately are in place to provide us with new information and insight on the bodies of text they analyze.
